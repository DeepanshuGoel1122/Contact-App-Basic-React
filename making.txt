Uses Localstorage , React app

Open Terminal - npx create-react-app contact-app

in public folder- delete all stuff just retain (index.html, favicon.ico)

in src folder- delete all stuff just retain (app.js, app.css, index.js)

now make our own folder structure:
make component folder- move app.js, app.css file in component folder (all our component will be here)
create header.js, contactCard.js etc components



remove all the text inside return in app.js
return <div>Hello</div>
save file

Hello should be displayed..

for css we will use semantic UI
add semantic ui css link to index.html file
remove manifest tag


now import React from react and all our component in app.js

now return our components 

in header.js create function component, now export this file (export default Header)

in add contact.js create class component, 


if we want to pass data from parent to child we use props, if we want to pass something from child to parent we pass a function as a prop.

whenever the value changes, use effect help us to render it again.


after localstorag work is done-

npm i uuidv4 (it will give unique id for each contact).



all functionality working now..

but it is all on same url , we need different
React router is used for different routs

npm install react-router-dom --save

in app.js :
import {BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom'
